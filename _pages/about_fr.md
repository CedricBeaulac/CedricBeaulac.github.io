I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca) under the supervision of [Jeffrey S. Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/). I am only a few weeks away from completion. I have been exploring many statistical learning algorithms during the last few years. Recently, I am interested in Probabilistic Graphical Models such Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and State-Space models (SSM). I am studying their theoretical foundation, establishing new models and using such models in various applications such as survival analysis and time series. 


About the website
=====

I have recently released a Miscellaneous section containing unpublished articles, research projects or notes I wrote for myself covering a wide range of topics I studied the last few years.

I will release a French version of the website soon, it's a promise!

About me (personally)
=====

I was born in Montréal in 1990 and still visit the city quite frequently! I like coffee, video games, streaming, biking, sciences and most geek stuff. I am intrigued by game design in general but specially video game design. If I could duplicate myself, the other me would definitely study game design and I hope to find a way to combine both my passion for stats and video game design in some interesting way. I am also interested in "learning" in general. Lately I have also developed a taste for random arts such as showcased [here](http://art-aleatoire.com).
