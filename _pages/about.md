Le site web a une page d'acceuil en francais [ici](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/about_fr/).

I have been a professor of Statistics at the [Université du Québec à Montréal](https://statqam.uqam.ca) since 2022 where I teach statistical learning and run a research program on functional data and image analyses. I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) and at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) under the supervision of [Farouk Nathou](https://www.math.uvic.ca/~nathoo/), [Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/) and [Mirza Faisal Beg](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/faculty-and-staff/faculty/faisal_beg.html) in 2022 and completed my Ph.D. in [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca) in 2021 under the supervision of [Jeffrey S. Rosenthal](http://probability.ca). My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and statistics. My research focuses on the development of new models for image analysis by integrating machine learning models to functional data analysis.

About me (personally)
=====

I like coffee, video games, streaming, biking, computer building and most geek stuff. I am intrigued by game design in general but specially video game design. I am a father since summer 2024 and this is certainly the biggest event that recently happened to me. I am also interested in "learning" in general, wether is is machine learning or seeing my daughter learning new things about life! I have also developed a taste for random arts such as showcased [here](http://art-aleatoire.com). I am also trying really hard to learn Spanish!
