I completed my Ph.D. in [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca) in 2021 under the supervision of [Jeffrey S. Rosenthal](http://probability.ca). I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) and at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) where I am studying neurimaging genetics problems under the supervision of [Farouk Nathou](https://www.math.uvic.ca/~nathoo/), [Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/) and [Mirza Faisal Beg](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/faculty-and-staff/faculty/faisal_beg.html). My research focus is image analysis and image generation using a combination of machine learning and statistical appraoches. 

About me (personally)
=====

I was born in Montr√©al in 1990 and still visit the city quite frequently! I like coffee, video games, streaming, biking, sciences and most geek stuff. I am intrigued by game design in general but specially video game design. If I could duplicate myself, the other me would definitely study game design and I hope to find a way to combine both my passion for stats and video game design in some interesting way. I am also interested in "learning" in general. Lately I have also developed a taste for random arts such as showcased [here](http://art-aleatoire.com). 

About the website
=====

I have recently created a [french cover page](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/about_fr/). Things are moving pretty fast at the moment and the website will be updated quite regularly.
