Le site web a une page d'acceuil en francais [ici](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/about_fr/).

I have been a professor of Statistics at the [Université du Québec à Montréal](https://statqam.uqam.ca) since 2022 where I teach statistical learning and run a research program on functional data and image analysis. I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) and at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) under the supervision of [Farouk Nathou](https://www.math.uvic.ca/~nathoo/), [Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/) and [Mirza Faisal Beg](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/faculty-and-staff/faculty/faisal_beg.html) in 2022. I earned my Ph.D. in [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca) in 2021 under the supervision of [Jeffrey S. Rosenthal](http://probability.ca). 

My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and statistics. My work focuses on developing new models for image analysis by integrating machine learning models into functional data analysis.

About me (personally)
=====

I like coffee, video games, streaming, biking, computer building, and most geek-related topics. I am particularly interested in game design, especially video game design.

Since summer 2024, I have been a father, which is certainly the most significant recent event in my life. I am also fascinated by the concept of "learning" in general, whether it's machine learning or watching my daughter discover new things about life! I have also developed a taste for random arts such as showcased [here](http://art-aleatoire.com). 

I am also trying really hard to learn Spanish!
