Hello everyone!

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistical Sciences at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca) under the supervision of [Jeff Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/). I've been exploring many Statistical Learning algorithms during the last few years. More recently, I'm focusing my work on Probabilistic Graphical Modeling and Variational Auto-Encoder(VAE).

Regarding VAEs I would like to perform complete and well-designed comparaison with typical statistical Bayesian approach such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains(MCMC). As a vivid video game player I also stongly believe in the potential of generative models such as the ones provided by VAEs in order to create flexible, powerfull and computationnaly efficient procedural content generator. 

If you are interested in similar topics of research, I'd love to chat!
