Le site web a une page d'acceuil en francais [ici](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/about_fr/).

I am a professor of Statistics at the [Université du Québec à Montréal](https://statqam.uqam.ca). I completed a postdoctoral fellowship at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) and at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) under the supervision of [Farouk Nathou](https://www.math.uvic.ca/~nathoo/), [Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/) and [Mirza Faisal Beg](https://www.sfu.ca/engineering/faculty-and-staff/faculty/faisal_beg.html) in 2022 and completed my Ph.D. in [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca) in 2021 under the supervision of [Jeffrey S. Rosenthal](http://probability.ca). My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning and statistics. My research focuses on the development of new models for image analysis by integrating machine learning models to functional data analysis.

About me (personally)
=====

I like coffee, video games, streaming, biking, computer building and most geek stuff. I am intrigued by game design in general but specially video game design. If I could duplicate myself, the other me would definitely study game design and I hope to find a way to combine both my passion for stats and video game design in some interesting way. I am also interested in "learning" in general. Lately I have also developed a taste for random arts such as showcased [here](http://art-aleatoire.com). I am also trying really hard to learn Spanish!

About the website
=====

I have recently added a [Supervision](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/students/) section to the website. Since I am currently recruite Ph.D students, this page contains all the information you need to know before you contact me. It also contains information about past and current trainees.
