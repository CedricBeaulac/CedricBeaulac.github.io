I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistical Sciences at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca) under the supervision of [Jeff Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/). I've been exploring many Statistical Learning algorithms during the last few years. More recently, I'm focusing my work on Probabilistic Graphical Modeling and Variational Auto-Encoder(VAE). I have a strong research interest towards explainable A.I. and model interpretability. 

Regarding VAEs I would like to perform complete and well-designed comparaison with typical statistical Bayesian approach such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains(MCMC). As a vivid video game player I also stongly believe in the potential of generative models such as the ones provided by VAEs in order to create flexible, powerfull and computationnaly efficient procedural content generator.

About the website
=====

Even though the website has been officially released, there is still room for plenty of improvments. Organization could be improved and so is navigation. Any comment will be considered!

I also plan to release a French version of the website as soon as possible.  I would also like to include a new section "Other" containing various course projects and other research reports that weren't publish. I might as well include blog post about thoughts and feeling on academic related topics, such as the current states of research journals from a student perspective and personnal experiences with some models.


About me (personally)
=====

I was born in Montr√©al in 1990 and still visit the city quite frenquently! I like coffee, video game, Day9, bike, sciences and most geek stuff. I'm intrigued by game design in general but specialy video game design. Lately I've also developped a taste for [random arts](http://art-aleatoire.com).
