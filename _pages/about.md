I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Statistical Sciences at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca) under the supervision of [Jeff Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/). I've been exploring many Statistical Learning algorithms during the last few years. More recently, I'm focusing my work on Probabilistic Graphical Modelling and Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). I have a strong research interest towards explainable A.I. and model interpretability. 


About the website
=====

Even though the website has been officially released, there is still plenty of room for improvments. Organization could be improved and so is navigation. Any comment will be considered!

I also plan to release a French version of the website as soon as possible.  I would also like to include a new section "Other stuff" containing various course projects and other research reports that weren't published. I might as well include blog posts about thoughts and feeling on academic related topics, such as the current states of research journals from a student perspective and personnal experiences with some models.

(I have intentionnaly left out some typos and mistakes in the website so you can catch them! Send me an email if you find some and you will be rewarded with my thanks, amazing right ?) 


About me (personally)
=====

I was born in Montr√©al in 1990 and still visit the city quite frenquently! I like coffee, video games, Day9, biking, sciences and most geek stuff. I'm intrigued by game design in general but specialy video game design. I'm also interest in "Learning" in many ways. Lately I've also developped a taste for random arts suhc as showcased [here](http://art-aleatoire.com).
