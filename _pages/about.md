I recently completed all of my Ph.D. requirements and will graduate in June 2021, you can download my thesis [here](). I completed a Ph.D. in [Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca) at the [University of Toronto](http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca) under the supervision of [Jeffrey S. Rosenthal](http://probability.ca/jeff/). I have been exploring many statistical learning algorithms during the last few years. Recently, I am interested in Probabilistic Graphical Models such Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and State-Space models (SSM). I am studying their theoretical foundation, establishing new models and using such models in various applications such as survival analysis, time series and content generation. 

About me (personally)
=====

I was born in Montr√©al in 1990 and still visit the city quite frequently! I like coffee, video games, streaming, biking, sciences and most geek stuff. I am intrigued by game design in general but specially video game design. If I could duplicate myself, the other me would definitely study game design and I hope to find a way to combine both my passion for stats and video game design in some interesting way. I am also interested in "learning" in general. Lately I have also developed a taste for random arts such as showcased [here](http://art-aleatoire.com). 

About the website
=====

I have recently created a [french cover page](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/about_fr/). Things are moving pretty fast at the moment and the website will be updated quite regularly.
