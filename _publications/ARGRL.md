### Abstract :

*Over the years, many approaches have been proposed to build ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs), graphs used to represent the genetic
relationship between individuals. Among these methods, many rely on the
assumption that the most likely graph is among the shortest ones. In this
paper, we propose a new approach to build short ARGs: Reinforcement
Learning (RL). We exploit the similarities between finding the shortest
path between a set of genetic sequences and their most recent common
ancestor and finding the shortest path between the entrance and exit of
a maze, a classic RL problem. In the maze problem, the learner, called
the agent, must learn the directions to take in order to escape as quickly
as possible, whereas in our problem, the agent must learn the actions to
take between coalescence, mutation, and recombination in order to reach
the most recent common ancestor as quickly as possible. Our results show
that RL can be used to build ARGs as short as those built with a heuristic
algorithm optimized to build short ARGs, and sometimes even shorter.
Moreover, our method allows to build a distribution of short ARGs for a
given sample, and can also generalize learning to new samples not used
during the learning process.*
