### Abstract :

*The contributions in this article are two-fold. First, we introduce a new hand-written digit
data set that we collected. It contains high-resolution images of hand-written digits together
with various writer characteristics which are not available in the well-known MNIST database.
The data set is publicly available and is designed to create new research opportunities. Second, we perform a first analysis of this new data set. We begin with simple supervised tasks.
We assess the predictability of the writer characteristics gathered, the effect of using some
of those characteristics as predictors in classification task and the effect of higher resolution images on classification accuracy. We also explore semi-supervised applications; we
can leverage the high quantity of hand-written digits data sets already existing online to
improve the accuracy of various classifications task with noticeable success. Finally, we also
demonstrate the generative perspective offered by this new data set; we are able to generate
images that mimics the writing style of specific writers. The data set provides new research
opportunities and our analysis establishes benchmarks and showcases some of the new
opportunities made possible with this new data set.*
