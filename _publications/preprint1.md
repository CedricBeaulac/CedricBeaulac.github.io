### Abstract :

*The contributions in this article are two-fold. First, we collect a new hand-written digits
data set. It contains high resolution images a writer identification and various writer characteristics. The data set is publicly available. Second, we perform a rigorous analysis of this
new data set. For supervised learning, we assess the predictability of the writer characteristics gathered, the eect of using some of those characteristics as predictors in classification
task and the eect of higher resolution images on classification accuracy. Regarding unsupervised learning, we analyse the manifold produces by Variational Auto-Encoders. For that
particular analysis, the additional predictors collected give us a great insight on the compression mechanism of such model. Finally we also explore semi-supervised applications;
we can leverage the high quantity of hand-written digits data set already existing online. The
new data set shows great potential and our analysis provides a new perspective on computer
vision’s modern algorithms.*
