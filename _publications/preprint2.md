### Abstract :

*The main contribution of this paper is the development of a new decision tree
algorithm. The proposed approach allows users to guide the algorithm through the
data partitioning process. We believe this feature has many applications but in this
paper we demonstrate how to utilize this algorithm to analyse data sets containing
missing values. We tested our algorithm against simulated data sets with various
missing data structures and a real data set. The results demonstrate that this new
classification procedure efficiently handles missing values and produces results that
are slightly more accurate and more interpretable than most common procedures
without any imputations or pre-processing.*
