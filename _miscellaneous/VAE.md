In this short manuscript we introduce the Variational Autoencoder model as an extension of the well-known Gaussian Mixture Model. Various implementations of VAEs are introduced and we discuss the gap between the theory motivating the models and these implementations.

*Mid 2021 2021 Update* I am currently investing a lot of time on this project recently; it is reworked as a review of VAEs proposed improvement upon the problems of simple VAES. I will post a new version on the web site soon enough.

*Early 2022 Update* Some of my recent work on this project lead me ot investigate the evaluation of latent variable models which I have described in one of my recent [paper](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/files/MEGA_arXiv.pdf). At the moment, this project is on the backburner until I complete my postdoc and get some feedback on the aforementionned paper.
