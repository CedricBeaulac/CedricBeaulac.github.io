[Sidi Wu](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci/news-and-events/sidiwu-ssc.html) is a Ph.D student that I currently co-supervise with professor [Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/index.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html). Together, we are developping ways to integrate neural networks into functional data analysis. Sidi is on verge of graduating and obtaining the title of doctor!

Our work together lead to one publication [Neural Networks for Scalar Input and Functional Output](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/publication/SnC), one submission [Functional Autoencoder for Smoothing and Representation Learning](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/publication/FAE) and multiple posters and talks. Among those presentations, Sidi won the [2022 SSC Student Poster Presentation Award](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci/news-and-events/sidiwu-ssc.html) and the [2023 SSC Student Research Presentation Award](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci/news-and-events/sidiwuhashan-ssc.html) presenting our joint work. 

Sidi will soon be graduating and at the moment we are exploring concepts of interpretable functional neural networks.
