Sidi Wu is a Ph.D student that I currently co-supervise with professor [Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/index.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html).

Our work together lead to one publication so far: [Neural Networks for Scalar Input and Functional Output](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/publication/preprint5) and multiple posters and talks.
