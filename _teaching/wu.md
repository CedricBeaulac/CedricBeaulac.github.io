[Sidi Wu](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci/news-and-events/sidiwu-ssc.html) is a Ph.D student that I co-supervised with professor [Jiguo Cao](https://www.sfu.ca/science/stat/cao/index.html) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html). She graduated in 2024 and is now professor at [Fuzhou University](https://en.fzu.edu.cn/index.htm), Fuzhou, Fujian, China.


Our work together lead to two publications [Neural Networks for Scalar Input and Functional Output](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/publication/SnC) and [Functional Autoencoder for Smoothing and Representation Learning](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/publication/FAE) as well as multiple posters and talks. Among those presentations, Sidi won the [2022 SSC Student Poster Presentation Award](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci/news-and-events/sidiwu-ssc.html) and the [2023 SSC Student Research Presentation Award](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci/news-and-events/sidiwuhashan-ssc.html) presenting our joint work.
