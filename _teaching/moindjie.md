[Issam A. Moindjié](https://imoindjie.github.io/#index) was a postdoctoral research fellow at UQAM, co-supervised with Marie-Hélène Descary, and now holds a tenure-track position at the [Université de Perpignan](https://www.univ-perp.fr). 

Together we developed new models for curve alignment and shape analysis in images, leading to a framework for image analysis based on a parsimonious representation of key components. Our joint work has resulted in two submissions, both currently under review. 

In our [first piece of work](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/files/shape.pdf), we introduce an alignment procedure for contours automatically detected and extracted from images. These contours can be parameterized with very few parameters, making their analysis both efficient and interpretable—two key advantages of our approach. In our [second paper](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/publication/MultiShape), we extend the model to account for multiple objects, thus multiple contours, within a single image, and demonstrate its application to X-ray data.
