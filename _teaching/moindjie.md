[Issam A. Moindjié](https://imoindjie.github.io/#index) was a postdoctoral research fellow at UQAM co-supervised with Marie-Hélène Descary and now had a tenured-track position at the [Université de Perpignan](https://www.univ-perp.fr). 

Together we developped new models for curve alignement and shape analysis in images; leading to a new framework for image analysis based on a parcimonious representation of key components in images. Our joint work has led to two submissions, both currently under review. 

In our [first piece of work](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/files/shape.pdf) together, we define an alignement procedure for contours automatically detected and extracted from images. Contours can be parametrized with very few parameters and their analysis is interpretable; thus leading to a new framework for image analysis.  In our [second paper](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/publication/MultiShape), we generalize our proposed to model to account for multiple objects, thus multiple contours, within a single images and demonstrate how to apply the propose model on X-ray data.
