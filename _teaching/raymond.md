Mélanie began her Ph.D. program in September 2024 under the supervision of Professor Marie-Hélène Descary and myself. Together, we aim to develop novel techniques for edge detection using functional and wavelet-based approaches.

I previously co-supervised Mélanie Raymond with Marie-Hélène Descary and Fabrice Larribe during her Master’s program. This collaboration led to one publication: [Constructing Ancestral Recombination Graphs through Reinforcement Learning](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/publication/ARGRL).
