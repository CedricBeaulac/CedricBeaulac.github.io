Mélanie started a Ph.D. programm in September of 2024 under the supervision of professor Marie-Hélène Descary and myself. Together we seek to develop novel technique for edge detection using functional and wavelet approches.

  I previously co-supervised Mélanie Raymond with Marie-Hélène Descary and Fabrice Larribe during her Master's program. Our work together lead to one manuscript, [Constructing Ancestral Recombination Graphs through Reinforcement Learning](https://cedricbeaulac.github.io/publication/ARGRL) currently under review.
